Some of these are: * To create a best of breed development environment for Unix systems for C# and Mono. * Since its written in Gtk#, and we like Gtk# and we get good support from Gtk#, most likely it will add functionality to improve the Gtk# experience. * Today the IDE is a simple IDE and on Unix does not do GUI design, but we plan on adding a GUI designer. * We want to integrate the tools we have been building so far, so things like MonoDoc, NUnit-Gtk and the debugger should target MonoDevelop.
