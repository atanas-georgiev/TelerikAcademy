//Problem 5. Parse tags

//You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to upper-case.
//The tags cannot be nested.
//Example: We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else.
//The expected result: We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.
